# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This project is a simple web application that generates and displays a set of random lottery numbers. The application is built using modern web development practices, including the use of Web Components to create a reusable and encapsulated UI.

##- Features

- **Lottery Number Generation:** Generate a set of 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
- **Modern UI:** A clean and visually appealing interface for displaying the generated numbers.
- **Web Components:** The application uses a custom element (`lotto-numbers`) to encapsulate the display of the lottery numbers, making the code more modular and reusable.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dark & Light Mode:** Users can toggle between dark and light themes, with their preference persisted in local storage.

## Current Plan

    - Update CSS to use variables for colors.
    - Define light and dark color schemes.
    - Add a theme toggle button to the HTML.
    - Add JavaScript logic to handle theme switching and persistence.
- **Deployment:**
